pat dry wings or drumsticks with a paper towel. lightly season chicken with salt and finely ground pepper and let rest. fill pan with frying oil enough for a shallow fry and heat to about 350 F. lightly coat chicken evenly with corn starch or flour and fry until golden on all sides. fry only a couple of wings at a time so that there is enough space between each piece. make the sauce by mixing 1 crushed garlic clove with 3 tbsp each of water, sugar, and fish sauce and 1 tbsp of lime juice. once the chicken has finished and drained, toss wings in sauce under low heat until sauce thickens to a sticky consistency. garnish with red pepper flakes and/or finely-chopped scallions.
